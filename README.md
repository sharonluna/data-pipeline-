Data Processing and Upload Pipeline

This project is designed to scrape population data, transform it, and upload it to a cloud storage bucket. The project is organized into different folders for modularity, each serving a specific function in the pipeline.

Project Structure

```js
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── data
│   └── (output data will be saved here)
├── data-pipeline
│   ├── main.py           # Executes data transformation and cloud upload
│   └── .env.example      # Template for environment variables needed for cloud setup
├── web-crawler
│   └── main.py           # Executes web scraping for population data
```

Folders
data: This folder stores raw and processed data files.
web-crawler: Contains the script main.py to scrape population data from a public website.
data-pipeline: Contains the script main.py to process and upload the scraped data to the cloud. It also includes a .env.example file for environment configuration.

Requirements

Python 3.13

Required Python packages (install with pip install -r requirements.txt if provided)

Environment Variables:

Copy .env.example from the data-pipeline folder to .env and configure the following variables:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME: The name of the S3 bucket for data upload
etc.

Run Web Crawler
This script scrapes population data and saves it in the data folder.
bash
cd web-crawler
python main.py




Run Data Pipeline
This script reads the scraped data, transforms it, and uploads it to the specified cloud storage.
bash
cd ../data-pipeline
python main.py

Notes
Data Storage: The raw and transformed data will be saved in the data folder.
Environment Configuration: Ensure the .env file in data-pipeline is correctly set up with your cloud credentials and configurations.
